## Conclusion:

### Summarizing our findings, suggesting other features

This Airbnb ('AB_NYC_2019') dataset for the 2019 year appeared to be a very rich dataset with a variety of columns that allowed us to do deep data exploration on each significant column presented. First, we have found hosts that take good advantage of the Airbnb platform and provide the most listings. After that, we proceeded with analyzing boroughs and neighborhood listing densities and what areas were more popular than another.We found the most reviewed listings and analyzed some additional attributes. For our data exploration purposes, it also would be nice to have couple additional features, such as positive and negative numeric (0-5 stars) reviews or 0-5 star average review for each listing; addition of these features would help to determine the best-reviewed hosts for NYC along with 'number_of_review' column that is provided. Overall, we discovered a very good number of interesting relationships between features and explained each step of the process.
